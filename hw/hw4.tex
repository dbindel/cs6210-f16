\hdr{HW 4}

You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Contrary conditioning}
Given $C > 1$, find $A \in \bbR^{2 \times 2}$ for which all
eigenvalues are one but $\kappa_2(A) \geq C$.

\paragraph*{2: Interesting identity}
Suppose $X, Y \in \bbR^{n \times k}$.  Show that if $\lambda \neq 0$
is an eigenvalue of $XY^T$, then
\[
  \begin{bmatrix}
    -\lambda I & X \\
    Y^T & -I
  \end{bmatrix}
\]
is singular.  Via this formulation, show $\lambda$ is also an
eigenvalue of $Y^T X$.

\paragraph*{3: Vector recovery}
Suppose $T \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ is upper triangular and
$\lambda = t_{ii}$ is a simple eigenvalue of $T$.  Give a code
to compute a column eigenvector $v$ in $O(n^2)$ time.
\begin{lstlisting}
  function [v] = uptri_eigenvec(T,i)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{4: Somewhat symmetric}
Suppose $A = H + E$ where $H=H^*$.  Argue that if
$\lambda = \alpha+\beta \iu$ is an eigenvalue of $A$,
then $|\beta| \leq n \|E\|_2$.

\paragraph*{5: Real rotations}
Suppose $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ has a complex conjugate pair
of eigenvalues $\mu \exp(\pm \iu \theta) = \alpha \pm \beta \iu$
and corresponding eigenvectures $u \pm v\iu$,
with $\mu$ larger than the magnitude of any other eigenvalue.
Show that power iteration from a random starting vector gives the sequence
\[
  v_k \approx u \cos(k\theta + \gamma) - v \sin(k\theta + \gamma)
\]
for large $k$.

\paragraph*{6: Double-shift iteration}
Suppose $A \in \bbR^{n \times n}$ has a complex conjugate pair of
eigenvalues near $\alpha + \beta \iu$.  Without resorting to complex
arithmetic, give a two-dimensional variant of Rayleigh quotient
iteration that gives a rapidly-convergent estimate for the invariant
subspace associated with the pair of eigenvalues.  You may wish to
build from the codes in the notes first.
\begin{lstlisting}
  function [V,L] = rqi2d(A, a, b, rtol)
\end{lstlisting}
