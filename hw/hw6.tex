You may (and should) talk about problems with each other and with me,
providing attribution for any good ideas you might get.  Your final
write-up should be your own.

\paragraph*{1: Residual projector}
Show that if $\hat{x} = Vy$ satisfies $r = A\hat{x}-b \perp W$, then
\[
  r = \Pi b = \left[I-AV(W^TAV)^{-1} W^T\right] b
\]
and $\Pi$ is a projector.

\paragraph*{2: PCG}
In this problem, we explore some iterations to solve the 2D model
problem on a $100 \times 100$ mesh with a constant right hand side.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the MATLAB (or Octave) function {\tt pcg} to solve the
  problem with no preconditioner.  Show the residual versus iteration
  count on a semi-logarithmic plot.
\item Augment the {\tt sweep\_adi} routine in the class code so that
  it is symmetric (i.e.~after doing an $x$ sweep and a $y$ sweep,
  do a $y$ sweep and then an $x$ sweep).  Use this as a preconditioner
  for the PCG iteration and again plot convergence on a semi-log plot.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph*{3: Course evaluations}
Course evaluations will open at 8 am on Monday, November 28 (a little
more than one week in advance of the due date).  Your evaluations are
confidential, but we can check whether or not you completed them.
Please do complete the evaluation!  This will be worth a significant
chunk of this problem set.
